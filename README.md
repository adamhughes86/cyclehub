# Cyclehub - Liverpool

This is a project for Liverpool Cyclehack. It's an information website on how to get into cycling in Liverpool.

Currently it's a static html website served from PHP.

## Setting up locally
This uses Vagrant and a specific box called Scotchbox as a starter template. In order to get your local environment running you must install Vagrant and VirtualBox to your computer. (Follow this guide for more info - https://box.scotch.io/)

Once that is set up run `vagrant up` from the root of the project. 

The local ip for this project is *192.168.43.11*
